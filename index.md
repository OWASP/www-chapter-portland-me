We're back for the first OWASP Maine meetup of 2021!

**Hacking Modern Websites with OWASP Juice Shop** 

Have you ever thought about getting into web application security testing? Maybe you know a few things and you would like to sharpen your skills in testing modern single-page web applications? Well, this is the event for you. 

In this hands-on hacking workshop, Ben Allen (DC207) will dig in to one of OWASP's flagship projects, Juice Shop. Juice Shop emulates an e-commerce web application and is meant to show how modern JavaScript-based applications can be compromised. 

In this follow-along workshop we will cover:
-   What OWASP Juice Shop is
-   How to deploy your own Juice Shop on the internet for free
-   How to set your computer up for testing
-   How to hunt for bugs
-   An interactive walk-through of a few challenges

What you will need to follow along:
-   A computer with Windows / MacOS / Linux installed
-   A desire to learn about web application security testing

Hope to see you there!

**Code of Conduct**:

We hope you enjoy our events, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

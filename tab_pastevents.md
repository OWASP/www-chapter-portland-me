Application and software security are so vitally important in all aspects of the business especially with every company becoming a software company as they navigate through digital transformations.

With that being said ERP systems are some of **THE MOST** critical applications within enterprises today and come with their own unique set of security challenges.

The fine folks at Onapsis who 100% specialize in SAP and ERP application security will be on site to dive deep into these specific challenges. They will also review real world attacks on SAP ERP environments and discuss the best in class strategies and measures you can do to mitigate the risk of exploitation of your ERP environments.

Anyone who is involved in SAP ERP environments from both a software development and security perspective would gain a tremendous amount of knowledge attending this meetup.

| Topic | Jump into Mobile AppSec with the OWASP MAS Project |
| Location | IDEXX Corporate Headquarters  |
| Address | 1 Idexx Dr, Westbrook, ME 04092 |
| Time | 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM |

Mobile apps dominate all digital time spent online - but mobile AppSec programs often lag. Jumpstart your team and skills by stepping inside the OWASP Mobile AppSec Project (MAS), the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS), and OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) to learn about the fundamentals of mobile app security and the latest updates just released in OWASP MASVS V2 launched at OWASP Global AppSec in Dublin. Learn the differences in Mobile AppSec vs Web AppSec and how to put OWASP MAS project, tools and resources to work.

In this session we will drill down into the top 5 most frequent security issues found in testing thousands of mobile apps. Learn how to test for them, and how to teach your dev teams to prevent them with code examples, test examples, links to additional resources and how to build your own toolkit. Along the way we will hit the latest privacy and security updates with iOS and Android.

Hacking Modern Websites with OWASP Juice Shop

Have you ever thought about getting into web application security testing? Maybe you know a few things and you would like to sharpen your skills in testing modern single-page web applications? Well, this is the event for you.

In this hands-on hacking workshop, Ben Allen (https://www.dc207.org) will dig in to one of OWASP's flagship projects, Juice Shop (https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/). Juice Shop emulates an e-commerce web application and is meant to show how modern JavaScript-based applications can be compromised.

In this follow-along workshop we will cover:

What OWASP Juice Shop is
How to deploy your own Juice Shop on the internet for free
How to set your computer up for testing
How to hunt for bugs
An interactive walk-through of a few challenges

What you will need to follow along:

A computer with Windows / MacOS / Linux installed
A desire to learn about web application security testing
